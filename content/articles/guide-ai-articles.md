## Introduction {#introduction}

Claude Articles helps you turn research into crisp, readable chapters. The key is to align the outline, the content, and the table of contents so the reader never loses the thread.

## The Prompting Mindset {#prompting-mindset}

Treat prompts like briefs. Define the reader, the intent, and the tone. Then ask for a concrete outline before drafting paragraphs.

## Structure and Constraints {#structure-constraints}

Every chapter should start with a promise, deliver on it with evidence, and end with a takeaway. Use consistent headings so the TOC stays accurate.

## Publishing Checklist {#publishing-checklist}

- Verify the frontmatter fields are filled in.
- Confirm each chapter heading has a matching id.
- Preview the article and test the TOC links.
